# Indexing-Trans*Crip-Tech  
Index of technologies from, with and by present day and his-her-hirstorical Trans*Crip Community.

**About Licensing** 
Github does not yet have CC4R as an option for license, so I am adding it here as my preferred license for this work. Creative Commons + CC4R (https://constantvzw.org/wefts/cc4r.en.html). 

**About**  
This index departs from the question: What have you hacked to make it work for you and your community? Propositions of linear time? Assumptions about the correct amount of rest? Heteronormative assumptions on what constitutes kinship or family? A death of imagination around how to share resources? Logics around what health care technologies look like? Epistemological understandings of what "data" is good data?  

In this repository we share trans*crip technoscientific technologies so that we can take up space in what is called "technology". Moving with an expansive definition of technology that holds space for practices of community organizing, resource finding, and sharing, and techno-vernacular creativity ie. hacking stuff for our specific needs. 
 
Here we are indexing technologies that already exist, but might not yet be called technologies, towards making our lives plural, joyful, sustainable and full of connection and possibility.

**How to Index**  
Each entry to the Index has three parts: a shared keyword, the data object (article, image, video, sound, artefact, model etc.) and an "about" with some questions about each entry.

**On the Keyword**  
Indexing Trans*Crip Tech is critical of paradigms of quantification, knowing through numbers and enumeration is a limit to all the ways that we might know. While language is another sort of limit, in this Index it is played with and invented as a mode of finding the data objects and information associated with each data object. An example of how to invent a keyword is the following, so say you want to add to the index, this stand to pee pisser that your friend Fleshpiece made out of porcelain (see this stand to pee custom ceramic pisser: https://www.instagram.com/p/CyxtCbVslBAmB0E_60QjlTuxENflTXu5h50ceA0/?hl=en) - So, you download this video and name it with the year, context of this thing & author of who made it (in this case Fleshpiece). So Artefact, **Keyword**, 2023, Berlin - Germany, Fleshpiece. And the keyword for this artefact you decide would be "porcelain pisser". So the final titling info for your artefact would be: **Artefact, Porcelain Pisser, 2023, Berlin - Germany, Fleshpiece**. You can then use this titling convention for the data object as well as for the Q&A about this data object to enter into the index. 

**On the Data Object**    
Article, Keyword, Year, Context, Author(s)  
Image, Keyword, Year, Context, Author(s)  
Video, Keyword, Year, Context, Author(s)  
Sound, Keyword, Year, Context, Author(s)  
Artefact, Keyword, Year, Context, Maker/Author(s)

**On the Questions to answer about each data object**  
What makes this a technology?  
How does technology become defined with this artefact in mind?  
What is problematic about this as a technology?  
What relationship does it have to disability?  
What relationship does it have to trans/queer experience?  
What can this technology do?  
What does this technology interrupt?  
What questions do you have for this technology?  
What gratitude do you feel about this technology?  
What timeline does this technology engage with, challenge or re-route?
