About Licensing:  
Github does not yet have CC4R as an option for license, so I am adding it here as my preferred license for this work. Creative Commons + CC4R (https://constantvzw.org/wefts/cc4r.en.html). 

About:  
This index departs from the question: What have you hacked to make it work for you and your community? Propositions of linear time? Assumptions about the correct amount of rest? Heteronormative assumptions on what constitutes kinship or family? A death of imagination around how to share resources? Logics around what health care technologies look like? Epistemological understandings of what "data" is good data?  

In this repository we share trans*crip technoscientific technologies so that we can take up space in what is called "technology". Moving with an expansive definition of technology that holds space for practices of community organizing, resource finding, and sharing, and techno-vernacular creativity ie. hacking stuff for our specific needs. 
 
Here we are indexing technologies that already exist, but might not yet be called technologies, towards making our lives plural, joyful, sustainable and full of connection and possibility.
